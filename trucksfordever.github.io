      In Wyoming, the F series is the <strong>most popular</strong> vehicle.  May the Fords be with us!  Trucks Fordever.  Wyoming is the perfect places for trucks, whether you go off-roading, tow some boats or quads, or just want to have a nice vehicle.  <br>

      Up by the Tetons, there is a lovely little town with some city life.  It is not really big, but has some things you would see in a city.  There are some really neat shops including the cowboy bar.

    In Afton there is the biggest arch made out of Antlers crossing the highway that goes through the town.  If you come in from California, you can go under it to get to Jackson Wyoming.  At night, when you drive near it, you will see thousands of stars sitting above your head making your experience even better.

     Once you arrive in Wyoming, we will meet up in Afton and drive through the biggest antler arch in the world.  We will then drive up to Jackson, aproximately 75minutes of driving.  In Jackson, there is a mountain called SnowKing which we will climb up and see the little town from up above.  Once we have enjoyed the view, we will go on a guided tour down the Snake River.  We will be taken back to Jackson when we are done.  Then we will still have some time on our hands, so we will see if we can get a Ford to stop and give us a ride to Jackson Hole Ford.  We will spend sometime looking at the trucks and Mustangs, and then will walk back into town to Cocoa Loves and get some Gelato, and then walk to the Million Dollar Cowboy Bar and eat dinner there.  That will conclude the first day of you being in town, and there will be many more adventures awaiting for the next week.
